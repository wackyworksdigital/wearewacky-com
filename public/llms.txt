# Wacky Works Digital

> Custom Automation & SaaS Studio based in the UK. We build digital assets that generate revenue, save time, and automate workflows. We're not for everyone. And that's the point.

## What We Do

We help businesses automate boring stuff so humans can do interesting stuff. Our specialty is connecting AI, automation, and modern web tech to create systems that work while you sleep.

## Services

### AI Agents
Custom AI assistants that handle customer support, data analysis, and repetitive tasks 24/7. They're like interns but they don't need coffee breaks or complain about the wifi. We build GPTs for grown-ups - multiple AI agents sharing a company knowledge base but each with their own personality.

### Workflow Automation
We wire up your apps using n8n, Zapier, and Make.com so they actually talk to each other. Your CRM updates your spreadsheet updates your Slack updates your sanity. Google Cloud VMs running n8n via Docker - private automation servers with zero subscription fees.

### RAG & Knowledge Systems
Turn messy documents into an AI that actually knows your business. Custom knowledge bases, document Q&A, internal search. Like having an employee who read ALL the documentation - yes, even the 2019 onboarding PDF. Living knowledge bases that constantly check, reference, and update themselves.

### App Development
Mobile apps, web apps, SaaS platforms. From idea to app store. React Native, Next.js, modern tech stack. We build stuff that works on phones, tablets, and whatever weird device you're using.

### Websites
Fast, modern websites built with Next.js and React. Animations that go whoosh, SEO that actually works, and no more 'please update your plugins' nightmares. Not your grandma's WordPress. We rebuild WordPress sites in Next.js with proper animations.

### E-commerce
Shopify stores, product listings, checkout optimization. We make people click 'buy now' instead of 'maybe later'. Automated blog posts that make traffic go bonkers. Etsy listing machines where AI analyzes images, writes listings, suggests tags.

### AI Content Creation
AI-powered content creation: videos, images, blog posts, social media - all automated. Faceless YouTube channels, TikToks, Reels, whatever's trending. Short-form video series across platforms - all AI-generated, all performing. Make money while staying mysterious.

### Branding
Full brand identity packages: strategy, visual identity, tone of voice, guidelines. We'll make you look like you've got your life together, even if you don't. Brand-in-a-box delivery - like getting keys to a fully furnished house. All websites reserved, 20+ social handles secured, company docs organized beautifully.

### Self-Hosted Tools
n8n, Home Assistant, private AI, all on your own servers. No subscriptions, no data leaving your control, no big tech knowing your business. Self-hosted learning platforms - own your content. AI-powered smart homes controlled entirely locally.

## Portfolio - What We've Built

### Full Online Presence Setup
The full works! Shopify store, website, socials, logos, brand identity - all connected and looking fresh. We love these projects because we get to build something complete from scratch.

### n8n Cloud Server Setup
Google Cloud VM running n8n via Docker - private automation server with zero subscription fees. We had way too much fun setting up the firewall rules.

### AI News Curator Workflow
Daily news scraping across multiple sources, AI backend picking the juicy articles, all orchestrated through Google Docs, Apps Script and n8n workflows. This one runs while everyone sleeps.

### Hands-Free Shopify Blog
Traffic went bonkers after we set up automated daily blog posts. 100% hands-free - the AI writes, formats, schedules, posts. Client forgot they had a blog.

### Multi-Agent AI Team
GPTs for grown-ups. Multiple AI agents sharing a company knowledge base but each with their own personality - social media manager, customer service, personal assistant. They have meetings without humans now.

### AI Etsy Listing Machine
AI analyzes product images, writes listings, suggests tags, optimizes pricing. A monster workflow (affectionately). We spent way too long making it perfect. Worth it.

### Brand-in-a-Box Delivery
Keys to a brand new, fully furnished house. All websites reserved, 20+ social handles secured, AI handling text/image/video, company docs organized beautifully.

### AI Short-Form Video Blitz
Short-form video series across platforms - all AI-generated, all performing. Followers went up, engagement went up, client did zero filming.

### Self-Hosted Learning Platform
Custom learning platform, self-hosted, no recurring fees to course plugin companies. Your content stays YOUR content. We enjoyed sticking it to the subscription model.

### Living Company Knowledge Base
The company brain! All their apps connected to a central knowledge base that constantly checks, references, and updates itself. It's alive and learning.

### WordPress to Next.js Migration
We don't do WordPress. We rebuild it in Next.js with animations that go whoosh. Currently working on this one.
